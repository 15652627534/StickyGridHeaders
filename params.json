{"google":"","name":"Stickygridheaders","body":"# StickyGridHeaders\r\n\r\nStickyGridHeaders is an Android library that provides a `GridView` that shows\r\nitems in sections with headers. By default the section headers stick to the top\r\nlike the People app in Android 4.x but this can be turned off.\r\nStickyGridHeaders also automatically sizes its rows to the largest item in the\r\nrow.\r\n\r\nStickyGridHeaders has been designed to be adapter compatible with, and was\r\ninspired by, [StickyListHeaders](http://github.com/emilsjolander/StickyListHeaders).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`StickyGridHeadersGridView` is a drop-in replacement of any `GridView` in your\r\napplication and is used in the same manner. To display headers your `ListAdapter` must implement\r\none of either `StickyGridHeadersBaseAdapter` or\r\n`StickyGridHeadersSimpleAdapter`. The choice of the implementation allows you\r\nto decide between the 'Simple' version which automatically does some housework\r\nto enable the grid sections and headers, or the 'Base' version which leaves\r\nthat work to you so you can implement a specific solution for your data set.\r\n\r\nThe standard `ListView` is also supported in case you just want the benefit of \r\nthe improved row height calculations, the rows are sized to match the height of\r\nall items in the row, in StickyGridHeaders.\r\n\r\nThe simple adapter interface has the same signature as\r\n`StickyListHeadersAdapter` so if you are using the StickyListHeaders library\r\nyour adapters are already fully ready for StickyGridHeaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n![Example App Portrait Screenshots](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-czumJI4itgs/UQpW0mUNkII/AAAAAAAAGvY/WjjKTk3rF0s/s1600/screens-portrait-smaller.png)\r\n![Example App Portrait Screenshots](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-S_BbhWX6wTY/UQpW0cwUGEI/AAAAAAAAGvU/zzJXj-PcVbY/s1600/screen-landscape-smaller.png)\r\nThe example source code is included in this repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n```\r\nCopyright 2013 Tonic Artos\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n```\r\n","tagline":"An Android Library that makes it easy to make grid views with sectioned data and headers that stick to the top.","note":"Don't delete this file!
